You have provided a balanced view on the benefits and drawbacks of contextual computing. It is often difficult to analyse data on the same issue but from different sources and being able to differentiate which source is the most reliable. With humanâ€™s interaction with information, the same piece of information might be interpreted differently. There are 4 main types of data collected for contextual computing, they are social, interest, behaviour and individual. But the four types of data collected all leads to privacy problems. By law, I think the use of contextual computing still needs to be monitored. Inevitably, contextual computing will become a trend in a few years time, but the privacy issues still have to be solved.

I agree to your point of view. Human information interaction allows us to exchange information in a more efficient manner that aids our learning and broadens our horizons. HII comes into our daily life often, in particular, social issues. Different parties with different interest will have different opinions regarding the same topic, so I think it is important to analyse the comments and the links between different parties.

Thank you for your sharing.

In my opinion, not only did the frequent of human interaction increase due to rapid technology development, but also affect the way how people interact with other. For example, before the invention of the internet, the human could only interact other by direct chatting or calling each other. There is a lack of machine-to-machine interaction. Nonetheless, after the invention of WWW, different platform are connected to each other, the information could be shared, embedded on them freely. Besides, people are able to message others, video-chatting through the network.

This also explains why the information are now exchanged more efficiently so I think that we should enjoy the benefits and keep learning and updating ourselves.
